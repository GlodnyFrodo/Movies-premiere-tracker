# Movies-premiere-tracker
The movie and TV show release tracker application is a Python desktop application that allows users to track upcoming movies.
The application uses the TMDB API to retrieve information about upcoming releases and displays them in a table. Each row of the table contains a movie
title, release date, and the number of days until the release date.
The application provides a simple and convenient way for movie and TV show enthusiasts to keep track of upcoming releases and plan their viewing schedule.
